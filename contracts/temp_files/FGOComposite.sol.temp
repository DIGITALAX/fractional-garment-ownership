// NOTES ONLY - Implementation needed later
// This contract orchestrates the complete purchase flow

/*
KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:

1. PURCHASE ORCHESTRATION:
   - Receives: parentContract + designId + isPhysical from market
   - Checks: parent approves market, all children approve market + parent
   - Checks: edition limits (parent digital/physical, child physical only)
   - Result: immediate composite mint OR approval request workflow

2. COMPOSITE NFT (ERC721):
   - Represents ownership of a design instance
   - Metadata: parentTokenId, children references, physical rights status
   - Immediate mint on successful purchase (digital or physical)

3. APPROVAL WORKFLOW:
   - If not pre-authorized: create pending requests to parent/children
   - Parent/children can approve/reject requests
   - On approval: complete the purchase flow
   - On rejection: refund buyer

4. DELAYED MINTING COORDINATION:
   - Digital: call child.mint() immediately on purchase/approval
   - Physical: call child.mint() only after fulfillment confirmed
   - Track fulfillment status per composite

5. PAYMENT HANDLING:
   - Calculate total price (parent + sum(child prices))
   - Immediate payment for digital (designer + suppliers paid)
   - Escrow payment for physical until fulfillment (with approval workflow)

6. PHYSICAL FULFILLMENT:
   - Market confirms physical items ready
   - Triggers child.mint() with isPhysical=true
   - Releases escrowed payments
   - Updates composite metadata

FUNCTIONS NEEDED:

// Purchase entry point
function purchaseDesign(
    address parentContract,
    uint256 designId, 
    bool isPhysical,
    string customURI
) external payable

// Approval workflow
function approvePurchaseRequest(uint256 requestId) external // parent/child creators
function rejectPurchaseRequest(uint256 requestId, string reason) external

// Fulfillment (physical only)
function confirmFulfillment(uint256 compositeId) external // market only
function completeFulfillment(uint256 compositeId) external // triggers child minting

// Query functions
function getPurchaseRequest(uint256 requestId) external view
function getCompositeStatus(uint256 compositeId) external view

INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING CONTRACTS:
- Parent: must expose edition checking, authorization checking
- Child: must expose authorization checking, delayed mint capability
- Market: calls this contract instead of parent/child directly
